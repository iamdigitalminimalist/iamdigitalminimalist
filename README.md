### *Everything is a Work in Progress*

Hello beautiful people! Welcome to my GitHub profile 🤗

For many years, I saw GitHub as a social network for nerds. I'm not sure if it has changed over the years or if I have become a nerd myself 🤓

Either way, *I'm very glad to be here*. I feel fortunate to get supported along the way by the dev community and my mentors. The idea of building open-source tools together is unique and rare, considering we live in a material world. Thank you for your effort 🙏🏼

I'm currently working on a platform that helps people to make their job-hunt experience smoother and more organized. Here is a [link to the repo](https://github.com/iamdigitalminimalist/job-search-app).
